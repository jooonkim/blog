# Joon Kim

<br />

I'm a seller, a builder, and a student based in San Francisco.

I currently work at [Google](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joonkimamherst/) and work with some of our largest clients using Google Ads. 

I jump between reading & writing, studying & building, tinkering & exploring. I believe that a well-documented life is a good life, and so this blog is a collection of my writing and my photography.

## Some essays I've written

- [An Argument Against Shooting Film](/film)
