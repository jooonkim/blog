I'm a seller & a builder, a student & a teacher based in San Francisco & Seoul.

I currently work at [Google](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joonkimamherst/) and work with some of our largest clients using Google Ads. 

Given that a well-documented life is a good life, I hope you enjoy my collection of writing and photography.
