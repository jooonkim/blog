# Joon Kim

<br />

I'm a seller, builder, and student based in San Francisco & Seoul.

I currently work at [Google](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joonkimamherst/) and work with some of our largest clients using Google Ads. 

I jump between reading & writing, studying & building, tinkering & exploring. I believe that a well-documented life is a good life, and so I hope you enjoy my collection of my writing and photography.
